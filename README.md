## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Michael, a third-year student passionate about Java and software development. I love solving coding challenges, building practical projects, and exploring how software systems work under the hood.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my Java skills and exploring backend development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning about cloud technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, and how to deploy scalable applications.
- âš½ Outside of coding, Iâ€™m into football, discovering new music, and getting lost in a good book.
- ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about coding, cloud tech, football, or music!

See ya!
